# Third Person Combat

## Description
This plugin adds third person action-RPG combat functionality to a project. It features an equipment system (armaments and armor), an ability usage system, ragdoll system (along with an animation system) and a stat system. 
Given the abstraction of the aforementioned systems, the plugin can be used to create all kinds of combat systems, most notably systems from games such as Dark Souls, Nioh and Breath of the Wild.

## Target projects
The plugin is best used for third person action projects. It can be used for first person action projects (such as Skyrim) with slight modification. The plugin is not suitable for shooters.
